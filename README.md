Until the last moment, when I still could not reach my companion, 
I wrote the complete code independently and simulated the operation of the two people as much as possible to meet the requirements

1ypzhang.py is the full file
encoder1 first writes the encoder and then adds the decoder to the partner's code
ypzhang completes the task of pushing the code again after modification
example is meaningless

I tried to create a github account again and add it as a collaborator, but it's limited and that's all I can do at the moment
